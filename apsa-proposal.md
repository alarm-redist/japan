Estimating the Partisan Bias of Redistricting Plans in Japan: Application of a Redistricting Simulation Algorithm 

* Abstract

Many scholars have assumed that there is little to no room for gerrymandering to occur in the redistricting process in Japan because of the non-partisan nature of the process: in Japan, redistricting plans are drawn by an independent group of experts commissioned by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. 
However, there has yet to be a study that provides empirical evidence for this assumption, and it is questionable whether the process is truly non-partisan. 
For example, before redrawing the maps, the redistricting commission invites governors to submit opinions regarding how districts should be redrawn in their prefectures. 
To fill this gap in the literature, we use a state-of-the-art redistricting simulation algorithm based on Sequential Monte Carlo to simulate a large set of redistricting plans that follow all redistricting rules adopted by the redistricting commission. 
We estimate the hypothetical electoral outcomes under those counterfactual plans and compare them with the expected outcomes under the actual map adopted in the 2020 redistricting cycle. 
In this way, we empirically examine whether there actually is no gerrymandering in the Japanese redistricting process.
