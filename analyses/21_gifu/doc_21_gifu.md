# 2022 Redistricting for the House of Representatives Electoral Districts in Gifu Prefecture

## Redistricting Requirements

We incorporate as best as possible the rules that the Council on the House of Representatives Electoral Districts (hereafter “the commission”) follows by taking into account the following rules and practices:

1. The Act for Establishment of the Council on the House of Representatives Electoral Districts;
2. The guidelines adopted by the commission in the 2022 redistricting cycle; and
3. Other practices that the commission follows.

### 1. Act for Establishment of the Council on the House of Representatives Electoral Districts
According to the Act for Establishment of the Council on the House of Representatives Electoral Districts,

* The population ratio between the most populous and least populous districts in the country must not exceed two; and 
* “Circumstances such as administrative boundaries, geographical features, and transportation [routes]” must be taken into account.

### 2. Redistricting commission’s guidelines
According to the commission’s guidelines adopted in the 2022 redistricting cycle, known as the [policy for creating redistricting plans](https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_content/000794997.pdf),

* Districts must be contiguous;
* Municipalities must not be split in principle;
* Groups of towns and villages known as counties (*gun*) should not be split wherever possible; and 
* Natural and social conditions should be taken into account comprehensively

### 3. Redistricting commission’s practices
We follow the commission’s practices through:

* Only allowing municipalities to be split based on the boundaries of old municipalities that existed before 1999, wherever possible; and 
* Avoiding splitting municipalities into more than two districts. 

## Algorithmic Constraints

* We enforce a maximum population deviation of 22%.
* We also add a constraint to encourage the creation of geographically compact districts.

## Pre-processing Notes

* No manual pre-processing decisions were necessary.

## Simulation Notes

* We sample 50,000 districting plans across 4 independent runs of the Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm.
* We do not allow municipalities to be split except for those that were split in the 2017 or 2022 map. In the case of Gifu, we allow 岐阜市 (Gifu-shi) to be split along the boundaries of pre-merger municipalities.
* In addition, we do not allow counties (*gun*) to be split except for those that were split in the 2017 map. In the case of Gifu, we do not allow any counties (*gun*) to be split. 
* We set the population temperance at 0.05 to avoid bottlenecks.
* Finally, we remove plans with discontiguous districts as well as plans that split municipalities into three or more districts, after which we thin the sample to down to 5,000 plans.
